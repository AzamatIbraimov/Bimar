# Bimar App
Mobile application for Bimar supermarket

# Description
A friend of mine has a supermarket called Bimar. He had a lot of problems during the lockdown. People were scared of leaving their houses. But they have to.
So my friend asked me to create a little app, which will help people to buy products from home.
Using this app customers able to order something from home. 
First of all I draw a Figma prototype:

Then I started implementing the whole android part.
